# CensusScheduler

Census Scheduler Volunteer Management when there is no internet access. The primary goal is a system that can run a server for volunteer mangement that uses tablets as the primary interface.

see https://github.com/mbhewitt/CensusScheduler/blob/main/OPS_Install.md for server install and https://github.com/mbhewitt/CensusScheduler/blob/main/Tablet_setup.md for tablet setup.

Please bear with us as a lot of this documentation needs updating/creating.
